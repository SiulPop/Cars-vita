# Cars-vita
This is a port of the original version Cars by CST1229 for the ps vita console.

A game based off of a Formula 1 game on an old flipphone i have.Unrelated to the movie of the same name.Credits, and controls are in the help menu.Enjoy!

# Issues--

-When pressing Quit the game mysteriously freezes

-There is a tool to "get bigger" that I haven't been able to implement, it doesn't bother the gameplay at all, but I might add it in a future update.

# How to install--

-Just download the .vpk of the game and install it with vitashell.
